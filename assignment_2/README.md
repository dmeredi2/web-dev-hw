# Assignment 2
## Demi Meredith

The internet is such a fascinating source and holds an abundance of information in which a majority of individuals use each and every day here in the USA. The power in which it holds is astonishing. My father and brother both have degrees in IT, and it always has amazed me how much knowledge they hold when it comes to the internet, computers and devices. It seems like they always know exactly what to do when issues occur. When deciding what upper division course to take, I decided that Intro to Web Design was a great choice because knowing the science behind the internet is something that I always have found interesting. I always have wanted to learn how to create my own website, and I figured this was a great way to do it. I have to hold myself accountable for my success in the course and learn the material versus trying to learn the art on my own. I am very excited to expand my knowledge in a different fiend then I have been vigorously studying over the past year, in hopes of becoming the best Speech Language Pathologist that I can possibly be.

1. I learned that Vint Cert, and Bob Kahn worked together to create the internet
2. I hope to learn how to successfully create my own website
3. I hope to learn how to successfully navigate all tools necessary in managing and maintain my website in the future
