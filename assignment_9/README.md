15. Assignment 9 was not quite as challenging or frustrating for me as assignment 8 was. The most challenging part of this assignment was assigning the class and id tags to have the style css sheet and matching them appropriately. I also caught myself struggling with the css attributes of figuring out what attributes were needed to control specific elements within the webpage. I think that this assignment was defiantly one of the most exciting ones because I love designing and styling things that match and flow together. After reading all of the instructions, I was super excited to begin this process. I read through all of the assignment specifics and began the process. When I ran into errors, I utilized external recourses to complete the assignment. At the duration of my assignment, I pushed and committed my work. I am enjoying pushing through this high speed coursen, and learning how to create and style webpages.
