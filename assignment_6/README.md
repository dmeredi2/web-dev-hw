13. While borrowing the web, forms are very commonly used, and asked of from the user. Even when conducting something as simple as a Google search, forms are used. When taking tests of Moodle, forms are also used for multiple choice, check all that apply questions, or even free response questions. All collect the inputted data and record what the student’s answers were. Moodle also asked students to upload many files, another use of forms. When signing up for a website, to become a member, one also must fill out a form. When signing into your favorite website, one must use of a form. Doctors’ offices also use forms, when collecting patient history and information. The use and list of forms is infinite, and something that most individuals, including myself often do not think about. There is a lot that goes into creating something that looks so simple and appealing to the human eye behind closed doors.
Forms serve many different purposes that are specific to the website and what it is asking the visitor to do, or the type of information that it is trying to gather. Ex: Drop down boxes, text entry, buttons, checkmarks, password input, submission buttons, and file uploads.

15. When working on this task, I found it to be more challenging then the past assignments that we have been assigned throughout the course, although I felt like I learned a lot. I used the same tactic as I have been using. I simply go through the “Intro-Web Dev” website, and review all of the information that is provided. I read through each slide, to ensure that I know where to find the information if it is needed. The next thing that I did after reading was, I went onto Moodle and began to read the assignments directions. I created, my files and folders on Atom and began my work. I worked within each file and followed each step to the best of my abilities to create a webpage specific to the guidelines that we were provided with. When I got stuck on specific parts of the assignment, I used additional recourses to help aid me in the process. I also found myself getting caught up on sections for a longer period of time, to help keep track of sections that I needed to review I kept a running sticky note with each section that I needed to refer back to and do additional research on. I then backed up all of my work periodically throughout the assignment through GitHub desktop, and saved my course work on Atom to ensure that everything was and would be safe if I ran into any issues. I then copied both links into my Moodle assignment sheet and hit submit once I felt that I completed all tasks to the best of my abilities.
