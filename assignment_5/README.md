1. There can only be one <head> and one <body> element on a page. The body element contains all of the contents of an HTML document, such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc. The head element can include a title for the document, scripts, styles, meta information, and more. These elements are different because the <head> element is used by the browser and is not seen by the user. The <body> is used by the browser and defines what is displayed to the user.
2. 2. Structural markup defines paragraphs, line breaks, lists, spacing, etc. where semantic markup is used to interpret the meaning and emphasize words or phrases, such as bolding, italicize, underlining, etc.
