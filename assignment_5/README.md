13. There can only be one <head> and one <body> element on a page. The body element contains all of the contents of an HTML document, such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc. The head element can include a title for the document, scripts, styles, meta information, and more. These elements are different because the <head> element is used by the browser and is not seen by the user. The <body> is used by the browser and defines what is displayed to the user.
14. 2. Structural markup defines paragraphs, line breaks, lists, spacing, etc. where semantic markup is used to interpret the meaning and emphasize words or phrases, such as bolding, italicize, underlining, etc.
15. Upon starting this assignment, I opened up Atom, and created a new folder and files that were designated to assignment 5. I had GitHub Desktop open throughout, and constantly backed up my work to ensure that no issues were ran into if my computer died or glitched. I had multiple pages open, and constantly bounced back and forth between each to ensure that all instructions were followed thoroughly. I noticed that it was helpful to review the chapter before attempting the assignment so that I knew where to retrieve information from. I then followed each step and completed the assignment to the best of my abilities. I completed the assignment by backing up all information, and copying and pasting the URLâ€™s into the assignment section on Moodle.
