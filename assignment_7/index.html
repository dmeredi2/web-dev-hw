    <h1>Wrecking Ball</h1>
    <h2>Miley Cyrus</h2>
    <p>
  	<pre>
  		We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
  		We jumped, never asking why
  		We kissed, I fell under your spell
  		A love no one could deny

  		Don't you ever say I just walked away
  		I will always want you
  		I can't live a lie, running for my life
  		I will always want you

  		I came in like a wrecking ball
  		I never hit so hard in love
  		All I wanted was to break your walls
  		All you ever did was break me
  		Yeah, you wreck me

  		I put you high up in the sky
  		And now, you're not coming down
  		It slowly turned, you let me burn
  		And now, we're ashes on the ground

  		Don't you ever say I just walked away
  		I will always want you
  		I can't live a lie, running for my life
  		I will always want you

  		I came in like a wrecking ball
  		I never hit so hard in love
  		All I wanted was to break your walls
  		All you ever did was break me

  		I came in like a wrecking ball
  		Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
  		Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
  		All you ever did was break me
  		Yeah, you wreck me

  		I never meant to start a war
  		I just wanted you to let me in
  		And instead of using force
  		I guess I should've let you in
  		I never meant to start a war
  		I just wanted you to let me in
  		I guess I should've let you in

  		Don't you ever say I just walked away
  		I will always want you

  		I came in like a wrecking ball
  		I never hit so hard in love
  		All I wanted was to break your walls
  		All you ever did was break me
  		I came in like a wrecking ball
  		Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
  		Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
  		All you ever did was break me
  		Yeah, you, you wreck me

  		Yeah, you, you wreck me
