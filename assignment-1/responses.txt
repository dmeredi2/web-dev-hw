1. The internet was created by 2 men named, Vint Cert, and Bob Kahn in the early 1970's. The internet was a result of an experiment called the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, the goal of ARPANET, was to create a form of communication that would last through a nuclear attack and be left undisturbed. This idea led Vint Cert and Bob Kahn to build an “experimental package network” which was very successful and is what we now all call the internet. There is not actual individual who controls the internet. The internet is made up of numerous networks that are ran independently. What makes the internet unique that that a multitude of devices are able to, allowing individuals to share knowledge and information. The internet is a very powerful tool used in many individuals lives each and every day. The internet is something that individuals have become attached to throughout the past couple of years and rely on heavily to carry out day to day tasks in many countries. Andrew Blum made a great point when stating that “Our attention is constantly divided” with having extended access to the internet.  Meaning that we are constantly focusing on multiple things (the inside (our phones) and the outside world). “The world inside the screen seems to have no physical reality of its own” one cannot see, feel or touch the internet, but it is something that we interact with each and every day. The internet is essentially a “box”, in which allows us to connect to the universe. These connections rely on the routers of one network making a successful connection to another network, making information easily exchangeable.  One country needs multiple connections to ensure that their internet is continuously working. If one signal breaks, there must be a backup source. 
*There are cables under the ocean 3-5-8 thousand miles in length, in which light passes through one end of the ocean and comes out on the other, the signal is amplified throughout this length, and transmitted to the end. This is how internet is sent and received*
The world wide web, and the internet are often thought of to be the same thing, when in reality, they are not. 
Before either of these existed, computers existed, although they could not connect globally. Connecting to a different model of computer is essentially what the internet is. 
The way that information is organized on the internet is what the web is, keeping an organized log of information and making it easily accessible to find and navigate. The internet connects PARTICIPANTS, while the web connects INFORMATION. The web allows information to be available easily. The web is something that you can see yourself in, versus a connection of wires that seems intangible. There is a separate part of the web that individuals typically do not associate nor think of due to the fact that it is invisible to search engines. The part of the web that individuals tend to push aside is what is invisible to search engines. The web is something that individuals explore each and every day. Web Development is a process in which a website that will be placed on the internet is created and built. Web development is not web design.   
2. The internet is essentially a tiered connection typically in the form of a wire (which may be fiberoptic, copper, or may be beamed via satellites. The internet allows two different computers/ devices to connect to one another if they are connected to the “wire” or source of connection. A server is special computer that is connected directly to the internet, and webpages are specific to servers. Each server has its own identification number, which is translated to a name such as “Google, Facebook, etc.”. One’s individual device such as a computer or a cell phone is not considered a server because tit is not directly connected to the wire/ internet. This is called a client because it is connected “indirectly to the wire through a service provider”. When information is initially sent through the internet, it is broken up into pieces along its route, these are called packets. These are then reassembled in their original order to create a photo, tweet, etc. upon reaching its destination. Everything connected to the internet has an IP address. When two or more pieces of the internet converge, a router is in-between, and these are what direct your packets around the internet and allow information to flow to and from your computer to another source. Routers send information to servers. Each time the information reaches a new layer, another layer of information is added until the information reaches the server successfully.  Once the information reaches the server, it sends back packets and sends the reverts the information to the device in which it belongs. This is a fast and continuous process of the transmission of information. 
3. A directory is, essentially a file, or a folder. Each directory contains files that are related to one another. The term “directory” is specifically used when discussing file systems. Directories are arranged in a hierarchy/ a tree structure/ a web in which related topics are organized. The top directory is called the root directory. The folder in which one is using is called the active directory, and any directories inferior to these are called subdirectories. 
Directories may also be referred to in terms of the relationships in which they possess. For example, immediate family which implies the parent and the children, and extended refers to the grandparents and the grandchildren, etc. Creating an organized and consistent directory is critical in the website’s functionality. 
Files and directories related because naming files incorrectly can cause sites to break, or malfunction. Managing your files is critical in your website’s functionality as well. 
A root folder contains all elements in which are critical for the websites. Calling this folder, the root folder, allows the creator to know that this will be directly uploaded to the web. Anything that is not directly related to the website will be placed in a relevant folder, not a root folder. Following a strategy will help you easily find information related to specific websites. In order for a website to function and allow individuals to easily access the website, you must have a folder called index.html. This must reside at the root level. 
When one names their files, it is critical to not place any spaces, and characters within the name, although one may use capitals and lower case periodically. Staying consistent with your files, and how they are named is critical. The use to dashes and underscores may be used to substitute spaces. Structuring your directory into files allows easy access to all folders and enables one to easily access and edit content when needed.
4. Using VCS is beneficial because, it allows one to have a point in time backup of your last known configuration, making it easy to back track if need be.
